<h1> The Beautifiul world of chess</h1>
<h2> where did chess originate</h2>
<p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly  <strong>1,500</strong>years to
its earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India;
 its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it
  spread to Persia, where it was modified in terms of shapes
   and rules and developed into Shatranj. Following the Arab
invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by ,
the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Europe via
Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy (Emirate of Sicily). The
 game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.
